    """
    Selection of avalanche danger prediction features based on random forest or decision tree feature importance and
    Pearson cross-correlation.

    Parameters:
        feats        Array of strings. All features the random forest was trained on.
        cross_c      Pandas dataframe. The cross-correlation matrix as containing the cross-correlation Rs of all
                                       features in feats.
        importances  Array of floats. The feature importances of all the features derived from the random forest.
        thres        Float. The threshold of the cross-correlation R above which features are dropped. Defaults to 0.9
        r_coef       String. Either R, R**2, or R^2 (the latter two are equivalent). Controls if the R or squared R is
                             used to drop features. Defaults to R**2.
        verbose      Logical. If True, a print statement reporting on the number of iterations is issued. Defaults to
                              False.
