Helper function: methodology mostly suggested by ChatGPT. The CHatGPT function was originally written to work only for
December. My contribution lies in extending to to work for multiple months.

    The function works as follows:

        In step 1 the indices for the requested months are found. Note that if one submits e.g. start_month=11 both 11
                  and 12, i.e., November and December will be used. The result of this, i.e., the variable "inds" is
                  a numpy array that contains True where the month is 11 or 12 and False otherwise.
        In step 2 an array of years is set up that increases the year by 1 for the choses months (in the example from)
                  above this would be for November and December) and leaves it unchanged for the other months. This is
                  done via xr.where(cond, x, y) which returns x if cond==True and y if cond==False. Thus, in or case
                  it returns year+1 for November and December and year for the other months. With that November and
                  December have been reassigned.
